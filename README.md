# Delayed Job Prevent Duplicate

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a7d6801105cc0df16e37/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/noesya/delayed_job_prevent_duplicate/maintainability)

The purpose of this gem is to prevent to re-enqueue on DelayedJob a task already enqueued.
So we set a "signature" attached to every task enqueued which is a composite from the class and the id of the object, and the method called.
And then when creating a new job we look in the "pending" jobs if there is another one with the same signature (not in the "working" one because a task can be executed and yet you want to re-excute it because of any change).

## Note

This gem is based on the work of [synth](https://github.com/synth): https://gist.github.com/synth/fba7baeffd083a931184

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'delayed_job_prevent_duplicate'
```

This line should be added after including the gem 'delayed_job'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Next, you need to run the generator:

```ruby
rails g delayed_job_prevent_duplicate:install
```

All should be fine now!
